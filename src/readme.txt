////////// ///////STAR TREK//////// /////////////////

Thank you for playing my game. Just a few things I would like to say.
All the images, font and sounds are used, no error message is used if they aren't loaded.

All the images I created myself, sound effect were sourced from the internet.
The background music is by Micheal Gordon Shapiro, 
though it has been compressed to hell and does him no credit.

I apologies for any spelling errors in my code, I don't think
Visual studios doesn't come with a spell checker as standard

After all that, I hope you enjoy my game.
